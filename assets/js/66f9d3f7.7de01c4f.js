At this\npoint, the parachain block is as canonical as the relay chain block its header appeared in. If this\nrelay chain block is in the best chain according to BABE, so is the parachain\nblock and when this relay chain block is \u2000nalised, so is the parachain block.\nBecause the parachain validators switch parachains frequently, they are stateless clients of\nthe parachain. Thus we distinguish between the parachain block B, which is normally enough\nfor full nodes of the parachain such as collators to update the parachain state, and the Proof of\nValidity(PoV) block BPoV , which a validator who does not have the parachain state can verify.\nAny validator should be able to verify BPoV given the relay chain state using the parachain's\nparachain validation function (PVF), the Web assembly code for which is stored on the\nrelay chain in a similar way to the relay chain's runtime. The STVF takes as an input the PoV\nblock, the header of the last parachain block from this parachain and a small amount of data from\nthe relay chain state.\nThe STVF outputs the validity of the block, the header of this block and its outgoing mes-\nsages. The PoV block contains any outgoing messages and the parachain block B. The parachain\nvalidators should gossip the parachain block to the parachain network, as a back up to the collator\nitself doing so.\nThe PoV block will be the parachain block, its outgoing messages, its header and light client\nproof witnesses. These witnesses are Merkle proofs that give all elements of the input and output\nstate that are used or modi\u2000ed by the state transition from the input and output state roots.\nTo aid in censorship resistance, a parachain may want to use proof of work or proof of stake to\nselect collators, where the selection strategy is up to the given parachain. This can be implemented\nin the STVF and need not be a part of the Polkadot protocol. So for proof of work, the STVF would\ncheck that the hash of the block is su\u2000ciently small. However, for speed, it would be useful to\nensure that most relay chain blocks can include a parachain block. For PoW, this would necessitate\nit being probable that multiple collators are allowed to produce a block. As such we will still need\na tie-breaker for the parachain validators to coordinate on validating the same parachain block\n\u2000rst. This may be the golden ticket scheme of. For proof of stake this may not be necessary."),(0,i.kt)("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlnjFIfwOH0",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:!0}))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
