This paradigm simultaneously achieves high\nlevels of security and scalability, as well as an unprecedented level of decentralization by\nensuring a property known in voting theory as proportional justified representation. Nominators, who\nare economically vested in the security of the system, act as watchdogs over the validators'\nperformance. Based on the nominators' expressed preferences over candidates, every era the system\nselects a set of validators with stake backings that are as high. and as evenly distributed as\npossible.

To achieve good scalability the number of\nvalidators in each of these subsets is small. Nonethe- less, thanks to the NPoS guarantee that every\nvalidator is well backed, the availability and validity scheme can ensure that any attack on the\nvalidity of Polkadot is very expensive in expectation. In fact, the entirety of Polkadot's economic\nsecurity backs every parachain. This is in stark contrast to having, say, 100 independent\nblockchains with an equivalent sum total of stake, where on average each blockchain is backed by\n1/100-th of the stake, and thus only benefits from 1/100-th the level of security.
