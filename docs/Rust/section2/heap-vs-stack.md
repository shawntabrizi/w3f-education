Throughout this course, a common occurrence presented is the notion of "putting" variables on either
the **stack** or the **heap**. This page provides a summary as to what each is and how they relate
to programming in Rust. Low-level languages have to be concerned with memory management and
allocation. This concept should be familiar if you're coming from a language like C or C++.

## What do the stack and heap represent?

The stack and heap are memory management and allocation concepts. They relate to how memory in any
program is managed, accessed and whether or not it can be changed in the runtime. The stack and heap
are two common methods to accomplish a program's memory management and allocation.

## The Stack

The stack is a linear model of storing objects on a "stack." It is faster than the heap, but also
less flexible as it can only contain objects of a known and fixed size. Known size in this context
refers to some value that can be calculated at compile time. Objects are pushed and popped to and
from the stack.

```rust
let hello: &'static str = "Hello, World";
// or
let x: u32 = 10;
```

Both `hello` and `x` are fixed size and value variables, meaning their memory profile can be
determined at compile time and they can be pushed to the stack.

In Rust, the stack is the default for managing primitive/basic values, call frames and local
variables. Non-primitives can also be put on the stack, but this is dependent on their lifetime and
usage (i.e., a `struct` that has elements of known size). The stack itself also has a limited size,
hence why the stack can overflow if too much memory is allocated to it.

## The Heap

The heap refers to a dynamically managed, hierarchical model of storing objects. It is slower than
the stack but provides a way to store larger amounts of data for modification at a later time in
memory. Objects stored on the heap are typically not known in size at compile time, meaning they
have the potential to grow and shrink as needed. Rust has many mechanisms to manage this memory
safely and avoid problems such as data races or dangling pointers.

In Rust, data structures such as `Vec` and `String` utilize the heap, which can grow and shrink
within the runtime.

```rust
// A vector in Rust, the Rust equivalent to an array
let vector_of_numbers = vec![0, 1, 2];
// Change this in the runtime!
modify_vec(vector_of_numbers); // [0, 1, 2, 3]

// A growable, shrinkable "String."
let hello_string = String::from("Hello, World");
hello_string.push('!'); // Adds an ! to hello_string
```

## Using `Box<T>` Reference Large Data

There may be situations where you have a large amount of data which is being pass around your
program.

## What decisions do you need to make?

In Rust, this memory management and allocation is handled for you. There is no special syntax to
dictate this in Rust, as it is already a part of the language. As you progress, you will learn how
Rust efficiently manages memory through the ownership and borrowing systems while providing
low-level access.

However, it is important that you understand how resources
